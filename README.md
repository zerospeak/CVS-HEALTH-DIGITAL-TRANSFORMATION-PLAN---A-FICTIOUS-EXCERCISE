Okay, I understand. GitHub's Mermaid renderer can sometimes be stricter or have slightly different parsing interpretations, especially with complex node labels containing special characters like parentheses or hyphens within the standard `[]` node definition.

The most common fix is to enclose the *entire* node label text within double quotes (`" "`) inside the node definition. This explicitly tells the parser where the label begins and ends, preventing it from misinterpreting characters within the label as syntax.

Let's apply this fix to all the potentially problematic diagrams and generate the final professional technical document.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1. High-Level Overview

The Health Hub Connect platform utilizes a cloud-native, microservices-based architecture hosted on Microsoft Azure. Frontend applications (web and mobile) communicate with backend services primarily via an API Gateway, which routes requests to the appropriate microservices. Communication between microservices often leverages gRPC for efficiency, while event-driven patterns might be used for decoupling certain processes. Data is stored in HIPAA-compliant Azure database services.

**Diagram Explanation:**

*   **User Interfaces:** Separate applications for different user roles.
*   **API Gateway:** Single entry point for frontend requests, handling routing, authentication, and potentially rate limiting.
*   **Backend Microservices:** Independent Go services deployed in containers on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Each service owns specific business capabilities.
*   **Data Stores:** Dedicated databases chosen based on data type and access patterns (e.g., PostgreSQL for relational user data, Cosmos DB for flexible patient readings or messages). Strict separation and security are paramount. Audit logs are stored separately. The `[(...)]` indicates a cylinder shape, often used for databases.
*   **Communication & Events:** Synchronous requests often use gRPC for performance. Asynchronous communication and decoupling are achieved via an Event Bus (like Azure Service Bus or Event Hubs). The `{...}` shape is a stadium shape, `(...)` is a rounded rectangle.
*   **Monitoring & Operations:** AKS manages container orchestration. New Relic provides performance monitoring. CI/CD pipelines automate build, test, and deployment.
*   **External Systems:** Integrations with third-party systems like wearable device platforms, EHRs, SDoH databases, and geospatial services are handled via defined APIs, often through dedicated integration services.

### 2.2. Architectural Style: Microservices

**Rationale:**

*   **Scalability:** Individual services can be scaled independently based on load.
*   **Resilience:** Failure in one service is less likely to cascade and bring down the entire application.
*   **Technology Diversity:** Although standardizing on Go, allows flexibility if needed for specific tasks.
*   **Independent Development & Deployment:** Teams can work on different services concurrently, leading to faster release cycles via CI/CD.
*   **Maintainability:** Smaller codebases are easier to understand, modify, and maintain.

**Challenges:**

*   **Distributed System Complexity:** Requires robust inter-service communication, monitoring, and distributed transaction management (if needed).
*   **Operational Overhead:** Managing multiple deployment units, databases, and monitoring requires strong DevOps practices.
*   **Data Consistency:** Maintaining consistency across service boundaries requires careful design (e.g., eventual consistency via events).

### 2.3. Communication Patterns: Event-Driven & gRPC

*   **gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call):**
    *   **Use Case:** Primarily for synchronous request/response communication between microservices and potentially between the API Gateway and backend services.
    *   **Rationale:** High performance (uses HTTP/2), efficient binary serialization (Protocol Buffers), strongly-typed contracts defined in `.proto` files (reduces integration errors), supports streaming. Ideal for internal service-to-service calls where low latency is important.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA):**
    *   **Use Case:** For decoupling services and handling asynchronous tasks. E.g., when a patient's status changes (event published by Patient Service), the Analytics Service and Notification Service can subscribe to this event and react independently without the Patient Service needing direct knowledge of them.
    *   **Technology:** Azure Service Bus or Azure Event Hubs.
    *   **Rationale:** Improves resilience (subscribers can process events even if the publisher is temporarily unavailable), enhances scalability (add more subscribers easily), promotes loose coupling.

### 2.4. Cloud Infrastructure: Microsoft Azure

**Rationale:**

*   **Comprehensive PaaS/IaaS Offerings:** Provides managed services for Kubernetes (AKS), databases (PostgreSQL, Cosmos DB), messaging (Service Bus), monitoring (Azure Monitor, integrates with New Relic), identity (Azure AD), etc.
*   **HIPAA Compliance:** Azure offers HIPAA-compliant services and Business Associate Agreements (BAAs), critical for healthcare applications.
*   **Scalability & Global Reach:** Allows scaling resources on demand and potential deployment across different regions.
*   **Integration Capabilities:** Strong integration with development tools and enterprise systems.

**Key Azure Services:**

*   **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** Managed Kubernetes for container orchestration.
*   **Azure Container Registry (ACR):** Storing Docker container images.
*   **Azure Database for PostgreSQL / Azure Cosmos DB:** Managed database services.
*   **Azure Service Bus / Event Hubs:** Messaging and eventing services.
*   **Azure API Management (APIM):** Potential API Gateway solution.
*   **Azure Monitor:** Infrastructure and application monitoring (complements New Relic).
*   **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):** For identity and access management.
*   **Azure Key Vault:** Securely storing secrets (API keys, connection strings).
*   **Azure DevOps / GitHub Actions:** For CI/CD pipelines.

## 4. Backend Microservices Design

### 4.1. Service Identification (Examples)

*   **Auth Service:** Handles user authentication and basic authorization roles.
*   **Patient Service:** Manages patient data, assessments, device data, care plans.
*   **Clinician Service:** Manages clinician profiles, availability.
*   **Coordination Service:** Manages coordinator profiles, task logic.
*   **Scheduling Service:** Handles appointments, routing integration.
*   **Secure Messaging Service:** Manages real-time chat and history.
*   **Device Integration Service:** Handles external device APIs and data ingestion.
*   **Analytics Service:** Generates insights, risk scores, reports.
*   **Notification Service:** Manages sending notifications (push, SMS, email).

### 4.2. API Design: gRPC & Protocol Buffers

*   **Contract-First Approach:** Define service APIs using Protocol Buffer (`.proto`) files.
*   **Structure:** Each `.proto` file defines `service`s, `rpc` methods, and `message` structures.
*   **Benefits:** Strong typing, language-agnostic, code generation, efficiency.
*   **Example (`.proto` Snippet for Messaging):** (Refer to Section 7.2 for the full code)

### 4.3. Data Management & Persistence

*   **Database Selection:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL (structured data), Azure Cosmos DB (flexible/NoSQL data).
*   **Data Modeling:** Design schemas for query patterns. Consider denormalization for NoSQL reads.
*   **HIPAA Compliance:** Enforce Encryption (at Rest & Transit), Access Control (RBAC), Auditing, Data Minimization, PHI Identification & Handling.
*   **ER Diagram (Conceptual):** *(Note: This diagram uses standard `erDiagram` syntax and should render correctly.)*

---

## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 6.1. Security & HIPAA Compliance

*   **Foundation:** Design in from the start.
*   **Data Classification:** Identify and strictly control PHI.
*   **Encryption:** End-to-end (TLS 1.2+ in transit, AES-256 at rest).
*   **Access Control:** Strict RBAC (Principle of Least Privilege).
*   **Auditing:** Comprehensive, secure audit logs.
*   **Infrastructure Security:** Secure Azure configuration, vulnerability scanning.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:** OWASP Top 10, input validation, etc.
*   **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs):** Required for third parties handling PHI.
*   **Regular Audits & Penetration Testing:** Periodic security reviews.

### 6.2. Authentication & Authorization

*   **Authentication:** Robust IdP (Azure AD/B2C), OAuth 2.0 / OIDC flows. Auth Service issues/validates JWTs.
*   **Authorization:** JWT claims (roles/permissions) validated by API Gateway and microservices on each request.

### 6.3. Monitoring & Observability (New Relic)

*   **APM:** Instrument Go services & frontends. Track transactions, dependencies, errors, DB queries.
*   **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Monitor AKS cluster, nodes, network (New Relic Infra / Azure Monitor).
*   **Real User Monitoring (RUM):** Monitor frontend performance and user experience (New Relic Browser).
*   **Log Management:** Aggregate and correlate logs (New Relic Logs / Azure Log Analytics).
*   **Distributed Tracing:** Essential for microservices. Propagate trace context across calls.
*   **Alerting:** Configure alerts on key metrics (error rates, latency, resources).
*   **Dashboards:** Custom dashboards for visualizing platform health.

### 6.4. Deployment Strategy (CI/CD, Kubernetes)

*   **Source Control:** Git (Azure Repos/GitHub), branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow).
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Azure DevOps / GitHub Actions. Automate build, test (unit, integration, security scans), containerization, and deployment.
*   **Deployment:** Push images to ACR. Deploy to AKS using Helm charts. Use Blue/Green or Canary strategies.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform or ARM templates for managing Azure resources.
*   **Kubernetes (AKS):** Define Deployments, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets. Use Helm. Implement HPA for autoscaling.

```

### 6.5. Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Tests:** Isolate functions/components (Go testing, Jest/RTL). High coverage.
*   **Integration Tests:** Interactions within/between services. Mocks/test DBs.
*   **Contract Tests (Pact):** Verify API contracts between services.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Simulate user workflows (Cypress/Playwright). Use judiciously.
*   **Performance Tests:** Load testing (k6, JMeter).
*   **Security Testing:** SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, penetration testing.
*   **Usability Testing:** Involve end-users.

## 7. Implementation Example: Secure Messaging Feature

(This section details the implementation steps as before, including the `.proto` definition, Go backend code snippets, React frontend code snippets, and the sequence diagram. The code itself doesn't need changes, only the explanation of diagrams if any were included here.)

### 7.1. Feature Overview

Allow a Patient to send a message to their Clinician, and the Clinician to receive/view it.

### 7.2. gRPC Definition (`.proto`)

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package messaging.v1;

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

option go_package = "github.com/healthhubconnect/protobufs/messaging/v1;messagingv1";

// Service for handling secure messages
service MessagingService {
  // Sends a message from one user to another or a group
  rpc SendMessage (SendMessageRequest) returns (SendMessageResponse);

  // Retrieves messages for a specific conversation thread
  rpc GetMessages (GetMessagesRequest) returns (GetMessagesResponse);

  // Subscribes to receive new messages in real-time (Server Streaming)
  rpc SubscribeToMessages (SubscribeRequest) returns (stream Message);
}

// Represents a single message
message Message {
  string message_id = 1;
  string conversation_id = 2;
  string sender_user_id = 3;
  string text_content = 4;
  google.protobuf.Timestamp sent_at = 5;
  bool read = 6; // Simple read status
}

// Request to send a message
message SendMessageRequest {
  string conversation_id = 1; // ID of the conversation thread
  string sender_user_id = 2;
  string recipient_user_id = 3; // Can be a user or group ID
  string text_content = 4;
}

// Response after sending a message
message SendMessageResponse {
  string message_id = 1; // ID of the newly created message
  google.protobuf.Timestamp sent_at = 2;
}

// Request to get messages for a conversation
message GetMessagesRequest {
  string conversation_id = 1;
  int32 page_size = 2; // For pagination
  string page_token = 3; // Token for fetching next page
}

// Response containing a list of messages
message GetMessagesResponse {
  repeated Message messages = 1;
  string next_page_token = 2; // Token for the next page, if any
}

// Request to subscribe to new messages
message SubscribeRequest {
    string user_id = 1; // User subscribing to their messages
}
```

### 7.3. Backend Service Implementation (Go)

*(Refer to the Go code snippets in the previous response - `internal/handler/grpc.go`, `cmd/server/main.go`. The code itself is correct.)*

### 7.4. Frontend Integration (React/TypeScript)

*(Refer to the TypeScript/React code snippets in the previous response - `frontend/src/services/messagingClient.ts`, `frontend/src/components/ChatWindow.tsx`. The code itself is correct.)*

### 7.5. Sequence Diagram

*(Note: This diagram uses standard `sequenceDiagram` syntax and should render correctly.)*
